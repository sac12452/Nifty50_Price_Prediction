   1. Applied various algorithms (ARIMA, XGBoost, GARCH) on stock market data, but achieved superior accuracy with polynomial regression 
   
   2. Therefore we finalized with polynomial regression model and evaluated it using R2 score and adjusted R2 score. 
   
   3. R2 score measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, 
	
 while adjusted R2 accounts for the number of features used, 	providing a more robust accuracy assessmen
